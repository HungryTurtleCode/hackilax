# Parallax Basic

This is the code to accompany this tutorial on Hungry Turtle Code.

Ultimately this code was turned into a much less hacky and generalised library to do the same thing which [can be found here](https://github.com/adiman9/ParallaxProvider). The actual web page implemented in this repo was also exactly reimplemented using the library and can be found [in the examples folder in the library repo](https://github.com/adiman9/ParallaxProvider/tree/master/examples/fixedModulesThenScroll)
